# recieve-mail
> A basic SMTP server in OCaml.

**Development on this project has ceased.**

This project provided an OCaml library that could be used to accept incoming messages via the SMTP protocol. The intention was not to be used as a fully-functional SMTP server but as a development component that could be used to test receiving of mail.

## Installation

This library is distributed through [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/), simply run `opam install receive-mail`. The [Findlib](http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html) package name is `receive_mail`.

## Development setup

Development requires a working OCaml installation and [OASIS](http://oasis.forge.ocamlcore.org/) installed. It is recommended that you use [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/) to install and configure Ocaml and OASIS. Please refer to the `Makefile` for build targets.

## Meta

Distributed under the ISC license. See ``LICENSE`` for more information.
